    <h2>Access</h2>
    <p>
      Even though whole API is public, we currently do not endorse 3th-parties on using it. It's not
      yet stable and there also is no way for users to give permissions to 3th-parties for accessing
      their data. This is on road map but not for near future. If you really want to use our
      endpoints, please come in contact with development team on github and you can help us
      implement this feature together.
